# Vinyl Crate

**Vinyl Crate** is a full-stack record collection management web application built using Django, Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app uses PostgreSQL for data storage and is deployed to Heroku with a responsive front-end styled using Bootstrap.

This project was created as my third milestone project for the Level 5 Diploma in Web Application Development with the Code Institute.

##  User Experience (UX)

### Strategy Plane

#### **Project Goals**

**Vinyl Crate** is a **personal record collection management app** created for vinyl enthusiasts, DJs, and music collectors. The platform allows users to build and organise a digital library of their physical records ‚Äî complete with metadata such as artist, title, genre, BPM, musical key, and cover art.

This app is designed to replace basic spreadsheets and paper lists with a user-friendly, mobile-responsive interface. Users can easily search, filter, and update their collections on the go ‚Äî whether they're browsing at home, preparing a DJ set, or crate digging in a record shop.

Vinyl records have seen a major resurgence in popularity, and tools like **Vinyl Crate** empower collectors to track, rate, and catalogue their collections in a modern, cloud-based format. Built as part of a Level 5 Web Application Development course, Vinyl Crate focuses on usability, functionality, and clean design to deliver a polished user experience for managing music libraries.

#### Target Audience

Whether you're tracking rare jazz pressings, building a DJ setlist, or simply documenting your growing collection, Vinyl Crate offers a streamlined, flexible space to manage your vinyl library.

**Vinyl Crate** is designed for:

- üéµ **Vinyl collectors** who want an organised, digital catalogue of their records  
- üéß **DJs** who need quick access to metadata like BPM, key, and genre  
- üì± **Mobile users** looking for a responsive tool they can access from the record shop or DJ booth  
- üß† **Music enthusiasts** who enjoy reflecting on and rating their collection  
- üìÇ **Users** who want to move beyond spreadsheets and static lists

**Vinyl Crate** provides:

- üìÄ **Personal record management** ‚Äì Add, edit, and browse your vinyl collection

The table below outlines opportunities for the **Vinyl Crate** project. Each feature has been scored for **importance** and **viability** (1 = low, 5 = high). This helps prioritise core functionality for the MVP. Features scoring highly are **must-haves**, while mid-scoring features are **should-haves**, and low-priority features are **could-haves** for future versions.

User roles are also considered in the planning:
- **Guests** ‚Äì Unauthenticated visitors browsing public-facing content

#### **Database Schema**

For this project, a relational database (PostgreSQL) was selected, as it offers the structure and referential integrity needed to manage user-specific vinyl collections efficiently.

The **initial MVP** focused on a single `Record` model linked to the built-in Django User model. This model stored essential metadata such as title, artist, genre, release year, rating, and a cover image. This simple structure allowed for quick prototyping, admin integration, and CRUD functionality.

However, during development it became clear that additional detail was needed to represent **individual tracks** on a vinyl release. Features such as **track position, duration, BPM**, and **musical key** were specific to tracks ‚Äî not records. Initially, BPM and key were part of the `Record` model, but this proved insufficient for multi-track records where values vary per track.

To resolve this, a dedicated `Track` model was introduced. Each track is linked to a `Record` via a foreign key relationship, enabling accurate representation of vinyl releases with multiple tracks per side. The database was updated accordingly to reflect this one-to-many relationship. The BPM and key fields were also moved from `Record` to `Track`, where they more logically belong.


This structure ensures scalability and aligns with database best practices by reducing redundancy and improving data clarity.

### Typography

[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) was used to import the selected fonts for the site, ensuring high-quality and accessible typography across all devices and browsers.

- **Headings (h1, h2, h3):** The font [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat) was chosen for its bold, geometric style that provides a clean, modern look. Its sharp edges and contemporary design help headlines stand out, giving the site a distinctive and polished visual identity while remaining easy to read.

![Montserrat Font Example](documentation/type-montserrat.webp)

- **Paragraphs and body text:** The font [Lato](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato) was selected for body copy due to its warm, friendly tone and excellent legibility at various sizes. It complements Montserrat without competing for attention, supporting a harmonious and user-friendly reading experience throughout the site.

![Lato Font Example](documentation/type-lato.webp)

- **Icons and UI elements:** The [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) icon library was used to support the visual interface with clear, scalable icons. These icons align stylistically with the modern fonts and enhance user experience through recognizable visual cues for actions, navigation, and social media links.

### Imagery

The imagery selected for this project was chosen to resonate with vinyl collectors and DJs ‚Äî the app's core audience. The carousel banners feature high-quality visuals sourced from [Adobe Stock](https://stock.adobe.com/), showcasing vinyl records, listening setups, and DJ environments to immediately immerse users in the culture and aesthetics of record collecting.

The example record covers displayed in the application were sourced from [Discogs](https://www.discogs.com/) to reflect real-world artwork and enhance authenticity. These visuals not only demonstrate how the app works but also give prospective users a sense of the interface when populated with their own collection.

Overall, the use of clean, bold, and culturally relevant imagery reinforces the platform‚Äôs purpose: celebrating analogue music collections in a modern digital format.

### Content

The content displayed throughout the site is based on my own personal vinyl collection. Record details such as album titles, artists, tracklists, genres, and release years were sourced from [Discogs](https://www.discogs.com/) ensuring accurate and comprehensive metadata for each entry.

All other written content ‚Äî including UI text, instructions, labels, button copy, and page descriptions ‚Äî was created by me to align with the app‚Äôs tone, functionality, and user experience goals.
