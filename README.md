### Project Overview

**Vinyl Crate** is a full-stack, data-driven web application that empowers users to catalogue, manage, and explore their personal vinyl record collection. Built with **Django**, **PostgreSQL**, and **Bootstrap**, it offers a clean and responsive interface suitable for both desktop and mobile users.

Registered users can add and edit detailed entries for their records — including artist, title, genre, BPM, musical key (Camelot notation), year, and rating — with the option to upload cover art. The app supports secure user authentication, individual dashboards, and record-level control.

**Vinyl Crate** goes beyond simple record keeping — it's a thoughtfully designed platform for music lovers and DJs who want to document and reflect on their collection in a structured, searchable way.

### Site Purpose

Vinyl Crate was created to address a common gap in vinyl record management: while many collectors rely on spreadsheets or handwritten lists, these methods lack visual appeal, accessibility, and interactivity. Vinyl Crate brings record cataloguing into the modern age with a secure, user-friendly, and mobile-responsive web app.

This platform empowers collectors and DJs by offering a clean interface to organise and reflect on their collection — complete with cover images, audio metadata, and personal ratings.

The app provides:
- 📀 **Personal record management** – Add, edit, and browse your vinyl collection
- ⭐ **Custom metadata fields** – Track BPM, musical key, year, genre, and star ratings
- 🖼️ **Visual enhancements** – Upload and display album artwork
- 🔐 **Secure access** – Private user accounts and dashboard views
- 📱 **Mobile-ready** – Use it from the crate or the couch

By focusing on clarity, simplicity, and personalisation, Vinyl Crate makes managing your vinyl collection a rewarding, modern experience — for hobbyists, DJs, and dedicated collectors alike.
