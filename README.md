# Vinyl Crate

**Vinyl Crate** is a full-stack record collection management web application built using Django, Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app uses PostgreSQL for data storage and is deployed to Heroku with a responsive front-end styled using Bootstrap.

This project was created as my third milestone project for the Level 5 Diploma in Web Application Development with the Code Institute.

##  User Experience (UX)

### Strategy Plane

#### Project Goals

**Vinyl Crate** is a **personal record collection management app** created for vinyl enthusiasts, DJs, and music collectors. The platform allows users to build and organise a digital library of their physical records ‚Äî complete with metadata such as artist, title, genre, BPM, musical key, and cover art.

This app is designed to replace basic spreadsheets and paper lists with a user-friendly, mobile-responsive interface. Users can easily search, filter, and update their collections on the go ‚Äî whether they're browsing at home, preparing a DJ set, or crate digging in a record shop.

Vinyl records have seen a major resurgence in popularity, and tools like **Vinyl Crate** empower collectors to track, rate, and catalogue their collections in a modern, cloud-based format. Built as part of a Level 5 Web Application Development course, Vinyl Crate focuses on usability, functionality, and clean design to deliver a polished user experience for managing music libraries.

### Scope Plane

#### Feature Planning

The table below outlines opportunities for the **Vinyl Crate** project. Each feature has been scored for **importance** and **viability** (1 = low, 5 = high). This helps prioritise core functionality for the MVP. Features scoring highly are **must-haves**, while mid-scoring features are **should-haves**, and low-priority features are **could-haves** for future versions.

User roles are also considered in the planning:
- **Guests** ‚Äì Unauthenticated visitors browsing public-facing content
- **Users** ‚Äì Registered members with a personalised dashboard
- **Admins** ‚Äì Staff or superusers with additional content management access
