<a id="database-schema"></a>

#### **Database Schema**

This project uses a **relational database (PostgreSQL)** to provide structured, reliable storage with built-in support for **referential integrity** ‚Äî ideal for managing user-specific vinyl collections.

The **initial MVP** centered on a single `Record` model linked to Django‚Äôs built-in `User` model. This model captured core metadata such as title, artist, genre, release year, rating, and a cover image. It allowed for rapid prototyping, admin integration, and full CRUD functionality.

However, during development it became clear that additional granularity was required to represent **individual tracks** on a vinyl release. Initially, fields like BPM and key were stored on the `Record`, which resulted in inaccurate or conflicting data for albums with multiple tracks. This design limitation highlighted the need for normalization.

To address this, a dedicated `Track` model was introduced. Each `Track` is linked to a `Record` via a foreign key, establishing a clear **one-to-many relationship**. Track-specific fields (such as BPM and key) were moved accordingly, improving both **data accuracy** and **model scalability**.

This updated schema follows **relational database best practices**, reducing redundancy, improving clarity, and allowing for future expansion ‚Äî such as sorting, filtering, or displaying track-level data.

#### Core Models

- `Record`
  - `user` (ForeignKey to User)
  - `title`, `artist`, `genre`, `year`, `rating`, `cover_image`, `slug`, etc.
  
- `Track`
  - `record` (ForeignKey to Record)
  - `title`, `position`, `duration`, `bpm`, `key`

The database schema diagram was generated using [dbdiagram.io](https://dbdiagram.io), which provided a clear visual representation of the relational structure between users, records, and tracks using DBML syntax.

### Skeleton Plane

<a id="wireframes"></a>

#### **Wireframes**

Initial wireframes were created using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) to plan the layout and user flow of the **Vinyl Crate** web application. Wireframes were developed for **mobile, tablet, and desktop** to ensure the site would be fully responsive and accessible across devices.

These wireframes informed the site‚Äôs **information hierarchy** and **user journey**, covering key views such as the homepage, dashboard, record collection, and record detail pages. They served as a visual blueprint throughout development, helping guide the placement of search, filter, and CRUD elements with a **mobile-first** approach.

> [!NOTE]
> Individual form views (e.g. add/edit record) were not wireframed, as Django Crispy Forms was used to handle layout and rendering consistently across devices.

### Surface Plane

<a id="colour-scheme"></a>

#### Colour Scheme

The Vinyl Crate colour palette is inspired by the rich textures and nostalgic warmth of analogue sound ‚Äî drawing from classic **record sleeves**, vintage **audio gear**, and the **glow of golden-hour light** reflecting on a turntable. This scheme balances modern clarity with retro flair, giving the app a tactile, curated feel that aligns with the essence of vinyl collecting.

The primary colours for the site are:

- `#40798c` (**Highlight Blue**) ‚Äì A muted teal used consistently in headings, buttons, and hyperlinks. It adds a calm, confident tone to the interface, echoing the **cool lacquer of vintage hi-fi systems**. This colour acts as a consistent accent across the interface.
  
- `#ffb633` (**Highlight Yellow**) ‚Äì A vibrant amber that evokes **sunburst vinyl**, **retro labels**, and **golden details** from 70s/80s record art. It‚Äôs used for **call-to-actions**, badges, and **hover states**. In gradients, it transitions into a richer orange to create depth and warmth.

- `#333333` (**Charcoal Footer**) ‚Äì A near-black tone used for the footer and navigation elements. It provides a grounding base for content, ensuring **clear contrast** and reflecting the **sleek minimalism** of album inner sleeves and turntable platters.

- `#efefef` (**Site Background Grey**) ‚Äì A soft, neutral background that keeps focus on content while evoking the **matte paper textures** of classic album inserts. It promotes readability and enhances contrast with primary accents.

- `#ffffff` (**Foreground White**) ‚Äì Used for text, icons, and form elements on dark or coloured backgrounds, ensuring **clean, crisp readability** across devices.

- `linear-gradient(to bottom, #ffb633, #f7931e)` ‚Äì This gradient is applied to **highlighted sections and banners**, giving them a dynamic, analog **warmth that mimics sunlight** filtering through amber vinyl.

These colours were defined as CSS variables for easy reuse and consistent application. Together, they create a cohesive, brand-forward aesthetic that reflects Vinyl Crate‚Äôs blend of nostalgia and modern utility.

#### Typography

[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) was used to import the selected fonts for the site, ensuring high-quality and accessible typography across all devices and browsers. Fonts are imported using CSS @import, with appropriate fallbacks defined for maximum cross-device compatibility.

- **Headings (h1, h2, h3):** The font [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat) was chosen for its bold, geometric style that provides a clean, modern look. Its sharp edges and contemporary design help headlines stand out, giving the site a distinctive and polished visual identity while remaining easy to read.

![Montserrat Font Example](documentation/readme/surface_plane/typography-montserrat.webp)

- **Paragraphs and body text:** The font [Lato](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato) was selected for body copy due to its warm, friendly tone and excellent legibility at various sizes. It complements Montserrat without competing for attention, supporting a harmonious and user-friendly reading experience throughout the site.

![Lato Font Example](documentation/readme/surface_plane/typography-lato.webp)

- Together, Montserrat and Lato provide strong typographic contrast‚Äîbalancing bold headlines with highly readable body text for an accessible, modern feel.

- **Icons and UI elements:** The [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) icon library was used to support the visual interface with clear, scalable icons. These icons align stylistically with the modern fonts and enhance user experience through recognizable visual cues for actions, navigation, and social media links.

> [!NOTE]
> Defined in static/css/style.css

```css
:root {
    /************ Typography ************/
    --primary-font: "Lato", sans-serif;

#### Imagery

The imagery selected for this project was chosen to resonate with vinyl collectors and DJs ‚Äî the app's core audience. The carousel banners feature high-quality visuals sourced from [Adobe Stock](https://stock.adobe.com/), showcasing vinyl records, listening setups, and DJ environments to immediately immerse users in the culture and aesthetics of record collecting.

The example record covers displayed in the application were sourced from [Discogs](https://www.discogs.com/) to reflect real-world artwork and enhance authenticity. These visuals not only demonstrate how the app works but also give prospective users a sense of the interface when populated with their own collection.

Overall, the use of clean, bold, and culturally relevant imagery reinforces the platform‚Äôs purpose: celebrating analogue music collections in a modern digital format.

<a id="future-implementation"></a>

#### Future Implementations

To expand the functionality of Vinyl Crate and improve the user experience, the following features are being considered for future development:

1. **Dark & Light Mode (Manual & Auto Toggle)** ‚Äì Introduce a theme switcher that enables users to toggle between light and dark modes, with an additional setting that respects their device‚Äôs system preference. This would improve accessibility and make the app more comfortable for use in different lighting conditions.

2. **Export Collection to CSV** ‚Äì Allow users to download their vinyl collection as a `.csv` file for offline reference, backups, or importing into other applications. This supports data portability and collection management flexibility.

3. **User Profile Functionality** ‚Äì Add a profile page where users can view and edit their personal information, set collection preferences, and track their activity across the app. This lays the groundwork for deeper personalization and community features.

4. **Discogs API Integration & Form Autocomplete** ‚Äì Connect to the Discogs API to allow users to search for records and auto-populate fields when adding to their crate. This would speed up the submission process and improve data consistency.

5. **Social Media Sign-In Options** ‚Äì Enhance account creation and login by offering OAuth-based sign-ins through Google, Facebook, or Apple. This simplifies user onboarding and provides a more seamless authentication process.

6. **Public Crate Sharing** ‚Äì Let users create a public view of their vinyl collection, sharable via a link (e.g. `vinylcrate.app/username`), great for DJs and collectors.

7. **Wishlist Feature** ‚Äì Allow users to build a "Want List" for records they‚Äôd like to add in the future, with possible integration to match against other users or Discogs listings.

8. **Community Comments & Crate Notes** ‚Äì Add the ability to leave thoughts or mini-reviews on records, fostering a social sense of discovery and shared taste.

9. **Advanced Filtering & Tagging** ‚Äì Introduce more powerful filtering options using multiple tags like sub-genres, moods, or special editions.

10. **Record Condition & Edition Info** ‚Äì Allow collectors to log condition (e.g. VG, NM), pressing variant, colour vinyl, and catalogue number for more accurate collection records.

11. **Track Previews via Spotify or YouTube** ‚Äì Add embedded links to sample music, where available, giving users a quick listen option before adding a record.

12. **Barcode Scanner (Mobile Only)** ‚Äì Enable users to scan a barcode to look up and autofill album data via the Discogs API.

13. **Bulk Record Upload via CSV** ‚Äì Provide an option for advanced users to upload large collections at once using a pre-formatted `.csv` template.

14. **Crate Backup & Sync Options** ‚Äì Let users export a JSON backup of their collection, or link a Google Drive account for automated backups.

15. **Monthly Summary Emails** ‚Äì Allow opt-in emails that highlight new staff picks, crate activity, or ‚Äúyou haven‚Äôt logged anything in a while‚Äù reminders.

These enhancements aim to enrich the Vinyl Crate experience while making it easier for users to engage with and manage their collections.

<a id="accessibility"></a>

### Accessibility

Accessibility has been a key consideration throughout the development of Vinyl Crate. Measures taken to ensure the site is inclusive and user-friendly include:

- Using semantic HTML5 elements to improve structure and navigation for assistive technologies
- Adding descriptive `alt` attributes to all meaningful images, including record covers and banners
- Applying `aria-labels` to interactive elements such as icon-only buttons and links for screen reader clarity
- Maintaining strong colour contrast across the UI, particularly in key areas like filters, buttons, and navigation (see [Colour Scheme](#colours))
- Ensuring focus states and keyboard navigability across all interactive components

Accessibility was evaluated using **Lighthouse**, **WAVE**, and manual checks in Chrome DevTools. Detailed results are available in the [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) document.

<a id="deployment-development"></a>

## Deployment & Local Development

<a id="deployment"></a>

### Deployment

The Vinyl Crate project is deployed using **Heroku**, with **Amazon RDS PostgreSQL** for the live database and **Cloudinary** for media file storage.

#### **Create the Live Database**

While `sqlite3` was used for local development, this is not suitable for production. Instead, a free-tier PostgreSQL database from Amazon AWS was used for deployment.

1. Sign in to your [Amazon RDS Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/) and click **Create Database**.
2. Select **Standard Create**, choose **PostgreSQL**, and select the **Free tier** template.
3. Set a unique DB instance identifier, master username, and password.
4. In the connectivity section, enable public access and ensure security group rules allow inbound connections from your IP.
5. Launch the database and wait for the instance to become available.
6. Once ready, copy the **Endpoint** and construct your `DATABASE_URL` in the following format:
    ```
    postgres://username:password@hostname:5432/dbname
    ```

#### **Heroku App Setup**

1. In the [Heroku Dashboard](https://dashboard.heroku.com/), click **New** ‚Üí **Create new app**.
2. Name your app uniquely, select a region, and click **Create App**.
3. Go to the **Settings** tab ‚Üí **Reveal Config Vars** ‚Üí Add:

    - `DATABASE_URL`: paste your constructed PostgreSQL URL (no quotes)

### Preparation for Deployment in VS Code (with PostgreSQL on AWS)

1. **Install required packages**  
   Install `dj_database_url` and `psycopg2` to enable Django to connect to an external PostgreSQL database:

   ```bash
   pip3 install dj_database_url==0.5.0 psycopg2
   ```

2. **Freeze dependencies**  
   Save the installed packages to your `requirements.txt`:

   ```bash
   pip3 freeze > requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Update `settings.py`**  
   Add the following import near the top of `settings.py`:

   ```python
   import dj_database_url
   ```

4. **Temporarily connect to AWS PostgreSQL**  
   In `settings.py`, comment out the default `DATABASES` block and add the following (replace with your actual AWS RDS connection string):

   > **This is temporary and should NOT be pushed to GitHub.**

   ```python
   DATABASES = {
       'default': dj_database_url.parse('your-aws-rds-db-url-here')
   }
   ```

5. **Test connection**  
   Run the server to confirm the connection works:

   ```bash
   python3 manage.py runserver
   ```

6. **Apply migrations to AWS**  
   If successful, migrate your models to the new external database:

   ```bash
   python3 manage.py migrate
   ```

7. **Create a superuser**  
   Set up admin access on the new database:

   ```bash
   python3 manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

8. **Switch between local and external DB automatically**  
   Replace the temporary block in `settings.py` with the following conditional logic:

   ```python
   if 'DATABASE_URL' in os.environ:
       DATABASES = {
           'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL'))
       }
   else:
       DATABASES = {
           'default': {
               'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
               'NAME': BASE_DIR / 'db.sqlite3',
           }
       }
   ```

9. **Install Gunicorn**  
   Add Gunicorn to serve your Django app in production:

   ```bash
   pip3 install gunicorn
   pip3 freeze > requirements.txt
   ```

10. **Create a `Procfile`**  
    In the root of your project, create a file named `Procfile` with the following line (no extension, no blank line below):

    ```Procfile
    web: gunicorn your_project_name.wsgi:application
    ```

    > Replace `your_project_name` with your actual Django project folder name (the one containing `settings.py`).

11. **Disable collectstatic on Heroku (for now)**  
    Prevent Heroku from trying to collect static files during deployment:

    ```bash
    heroku config:set DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC=1 --app your-heroku-app-name
    ```

12. **Update allowed hosts**  
    In `settings.py`, update `ALLOWED_HOSTS` to include Heroku and local development:

    ```python
    ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['your-app-name.herokuapp.com', 'localhost']
    ```

13. **Commit and push changes**  
    Save all changes, commit, and push to GitHub:

    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Prepare for Heroku deployment with AWS DB"
    git push origin main
    ```

14. **Connect to Heroku Git and deploy**  
    Link your repo and deploy:

    ```bash
    heroku git:remote -a your-heroku-app-name
    git push heroku main
    ```

15. **Verify deployment**  
    Your site should now be live (without static files). Re-enable collectstatic and confirm static assets are served correctly.

16. **Enable automatic deploys**  
    Go to your Heroku app‚Äôs **Deploy** tab:
    - Connect your GitHub repo
    - Click **Enable Automatic Deploys**

#### **Generating a Secure SECRET_KEY & Configuring DEBUG Settings**

1. When a Django project is created, it includes a default `SECRET_KEY`. However, using this default in production poses a security risk. Instead, generate a new secure key specifically for deployment and store it safely.

2. Use a tool like the [Django Secret Key Generator](https://miniwebtool.com/django-secret-key-generator/) to create a strong, random key. Copy the generated key.

3. In your Heroku dashboard, navigate to the app‚Äôs **Settings** tab and add a new Config Var:
   - **Key**: `SECRET_KEY`
   - **Value**: Paste your newly generated secret key

4. In your `settings.py`, update the `SECRET_KEY` definition to retrieve the value securely from the environment:

    ```python
    SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY', ' ')
    ```

5. Update the `DEBUG` setting so it is only enabled during development:

    ```python
    DEBUG = 'DEVELOPMENT' in os.environ
    ```

6. Save your changes, then add, commit, and push them to your repository:

    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Configure SECRET_KEY and DEBUG for secure deployment"
    git push origin main
    ```

#### **Set Up Cloudinary for Media File Storage**

To handle media files (such as record cover images), this project uses [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/), a cloud-based image and video management service.

---

1. Create a Cloudinary Account

- Go to [cloudinary.com](https://cloudinary.com/) and sign up for a free account.
- After logging in, navigate to the **Dashboard**.
- Copy your **Cloud name**, **API Key**, and **API Secret** ‚Äì you'll need these for your environment variables.

2. Install Required Packages

    Install the required Python packages using pip:
    ```bash
    pip3 install cloudinary django-cloudinary-storage
    ```

    Then update your requirements.txt:
    ```
    pip3 freeze > requirements.txt
    ```

3. Configure Cloudinary in Django

    In your settings.py, add the following:

    Add to INSTALLED_APPS:
    ```python
    INSTALLED_APPS = [
        ...
        'cloudinary',
        'cloudinary_storage',
        ...
    ]
    ```

    Configure the default file storage:
    ```Python
    DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'cloudinary_storage.storage.MediaCloudinaryStorage'
    ```

    Add your Cloudinary credentials:

    These will be pulled from environment variables for security:
    ```python
    import cloudinary
    import cloudinary.uploader
    import cloudinary.api

    CLOUDINARY_STORAGE = {
        'CLOUD_NAME': os.environ.get('CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME'),
        'API_KEY': os.environ.get('CLOUDINARY_API_KEY'),
        'API_SECRET': os.environ.get('CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET'),
    }
    ```

4. Set Config Vars in Heroku

    Go to your app on Heroku, open the Settings tab, and add the following Config Vars:

    ```python
    CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME = your_cloud_name
    CLOUDINARY_API_KEY = your_api_key
    CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET = your_api_secret
    ```

5. Use CloudinaryField in Your Models

    Your Record model (or any other models needing media upload) should use:

    ```python
    from cloudinary.models import CloudinaryField

    cover_image = CloudinaryField('image', blank=True, null=True)
    ```

Cloudinary will now automatically handle image storage, optimization, and delivery via CDN.
