#### **Database Schema**

For this project, a relational database (PostgreSQL) was selected, as it offers the structure and referential integrity needed to manage user-specific vinyl collections efficiently.

The **initial MVP** focused on a single `Record` model linked to the built-in Django User model. This model stored essential metadata such as title, artist, genre, release year, rating, and a cover image. This simple structure allowed for quick prototyping, admin integration, and CRUD functionality.

However, during development it became clear that additional detail was needed to represent **individual tracks** on a vinyl release. Features such as **track position, duration, BPM**, and **musical key** were specific to tracks ‚Äî not records. Initially, BPM and key were part of the `Record` model, but this proved insufficient for multi-track records where values vary per track.

To resolve this, a dedicated `Track` model was introduced. Each track is linked to a `Record` via a foreign key relationship, enabling accurate representation of vinyl releases with multiple tracks per side. The database was updated accordingly to reflect this one-to-many relationship. The BPM and key fields were also moved from `Record` to `Track`, where they more logically belong.


This structure ensures scalability and aligns with database best practices by reducing redundancy and improving data clarity.


<a id=typography></a>

#### Typography

[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) was used to import the selected fonts for the site, ensuring high-quality and accessible typography across all devices and browsers.

- **Headings (h1, h2, h3):** The font [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat) was chosen for its bold, geometric style that provides a clean, modern look. Its sharp edges and contemporary design help headlines stand out, giving the site a distinctive and polished visual identity while remaining easy to read.

![Montserrat Font Example](documentation/type-montserrat.webp)

- **Paragraphs and body text:** The font [Lato](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato) was selected for body copy due to its warm, friendly tone and excellent legibility at various sizes. It complements Montserrat without competing for attention, supporting a harmonious and user-friendly reading experience throughout the site.

![Lato Font Example](documentation/type-lato.webp)

- **Icons and UI elements:** The [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) icon library was used to support the visual interface with clear, scalable icons. These icons align stylistically with the modern fonts and enhance user experience through recognizable visual cues for actions, navigation, and social media links.

<a id=imagery></a>

#### Imagery

The imagery selected for this project was chosen to resonate with vinyl collectors and DJs ‚Äî the app's core audience. The carousel banners feature high-quality visuals sourced from [Adobe Stock](https://stock.adobe.com/), showcasing vinyl records, listening setups, and DJ environments to immediately immerse users in the culture and aesthetics of record collecting.

The example record covers displayed in the application were sourced from [Discogs](https://www.discogs.com/) to reflect real-world artwork and enhance authenticity. These visuals not only demonstrate how the app works but also give prospective users a sense of the interface when populated with their own collection.

Overall, the use of clean, bold, and culturally relevant imagery reinforces the platform‚Äôs purpose: celebrating analogue music collections in a modern digital format.

### Skeleton Plane

<a id="wireframes"></a>

#### **Wireframes**

Initial wireframes were created using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) to plan the core layout and flow of the **Vinyl Crate** site. These included views for mobile, tablet, and desktop to ensure the design would be fully responsive and accessible.

The wireframes helped shape the site‚Äôs information hierarchy and user journey, including key screens such as the homepage, dashboard, record collection view, and record detail view. They served as a visual blueprint during development, guiding the placement of search, filter, and CRUD functionality with a mobile-first mindset.

### Development Process

Vinyl Crate was developed using an **iterative, feature-driven approach**:

1. Planned the site structure, wireframes, and database schema
2. Set up the Django project with a connected PostgreSQL database
3. Implemented user authentication with Django Allauth
4. Developed core CRUD functionality for records and tracklists
5. Integrated Cloudinary for image uploads and Discogs for record metadata
6. Built dynamic filtering, search, and user dashboard features
7. Focused on accessibility, responsive design, and a clean UI
8. Completed manual and automated testing, README documentation, and deployed to Heroku

Version control was managed using **Git** and **GitHub**, with regular, descriptive commits to track progress and maintain a clear development history.

<a id=accessibility></a>

### Accessibility

Accessibility has been a key consideration throughout the development of Vinyl Crate. Measures taken to ensure the site is inclusive and user-friendly include:

- Using semantic HTML5 elements to improve structure and navigation for assistive technologies
- Adding descriptive `alt` attributes to all meaningful images, including record covers and banners
- Applying `aria-labels` to interactive elements such as icon-only buttons and links for screen reader clarity
- Maintaining strong colour contrast across the UI, particularly in key areas like filters, buttons, and navigation (see [Colour Scheme](#colours))
- Ensuring focus states and keyboard navigability across all interactive components

Accessibility was evaluated using **Lighthouse**, **WAVE**, and manual checks in Chrome DevTools. Detailed results are available in the [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) document.

#### Future Implementations

To expand the functionality of Vinyl Crate and improve the user experience, the following features are being considered for future development:

1. **Dark & Light Mode (Manual & Auto Toggle)** ‚Äì Introduce a theme switcher that enables users to toggle between light and dark modes, with an additional setting that respects their device‚Äôs system preference. This would improve accessibility and make the app more comfortable for use in different lighting conditions.

2. **Export Collection to CSV** ‚Äì Allow users to download their vinyl collection as a `.csv` file for offline reference, backups, or importing into other applications. This supports data portability and collection management flexibility.

3. **User Profile Functionality** ‚Äì Add a profile page where users can view and edit their personal information, set collection preferences, and track their activity across the app. This lays the groundwork for deeper personalization and community features.

4. **Discogs API Integration & Form Autocomplete** ‚Äì Connect to the Discogs API to allow users to search for records and auto-populate fields when adding to their crate. This would speed up the submission process and improve data consistency.

5. **Social Media Sign-In Options** ‚Äì Enhance account creation and login by offering OAuth-based sign-ins through Google, Facebook, or Apple. This simplifies user onboarding and provides a more seamless authentication process.

6. **Public Crate Sharing** ‚Äì Let users create a public view of their vinyl collection, sharable via a link (e.g. `vinylcrate.app/username`), great for DJs and collectors.

7. **Wishlist Feature** ‚Äì Allow users to build a "Want List" for records they‚Äôd like to add in the future, with possible integration to match against other users or Discogs listings.

8. **Community Comments & Crate Notes** ‚Äì Add the ability to leave thoughts or mini-reviews on records, fostering a social sense of discovery and shared taste.

9. **Advanced Filtering & Tagging** ‚Äì Introduce more powerful filtering options using multiple tags like sub-genres, moods, or special editions.

10. **Record Condition & Edition Info** ‚Äì Allow collectors to log condition (e.g. VG, NM), pressing variant, colour vinyl, and catalogue number for more accurate collection records.

11. **Track Previews via Spotify or YouTube** ‚Äì Add embedded links to sample music, where available, giving users a quick listen option before adding a record.

12. **Barcode Scanner (Mobile Only)** ‚Äì Enable users to scan a barcode to look up and autofill album data via the Discogs API.

13. **Bulk Record Upload via CSV** ‚Äì Provide an option for advanced users to upload large collections at once using a pre-formatted `.csv` template.

14. **Crate Backup & Sync Options** ‚Äì Let users export a JSON backup of their collection, or link a Google Drive account for automated backups.

15. **Monthly Summary Emails** ‚Äì Allow opt-in emails that highlight new staff picks, crate activity, or ‚Äúyou haven‚Äôt logged anything in a while‚Äù reminders.

These enhancements aim to enrich the Vinyl Crate experience while making it easier for users to engage with and manage their collections.

### Content

The content displayed throughout the site is based on my own personal vinyl collection. Record details such as album titles, artists, tracklists, genres, and release years were sourced from [Discogs](https://www.discogs.com/) ensuring accurate and comprehensive metadata for each entry.

All other written content ‚Äî including UI text, instructions, labels, button copy, and page descriptions ‚Äî was created by me to align with the app‚Äôs tone, functionality, and user experience goals.
