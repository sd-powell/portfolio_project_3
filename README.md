# Vinyl Crate

**Vinyl Crate** is a full-stack record collection management web application built using Django, Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app uses PostgreSQL for data storage and is deployed to Heroku with a responsive front-end styled using Bootstrap.

This project was created as my third milestone project for the Level 5 Diploma in Web Application Development with the Code Institute.

##  User Experience (UX)

### Strategy Plane

#### **Project Goals**

**Vinyl Crate** is a **personal record collection management app** created for vinyl enthusiasts, DJs, and music collectors. The platform allows users to build and organise a digital library of their physical records ‚Äî complete with metadata such as artist, title, genre, BPM, musical key, and cover art.

This app is designed to replace basic spreadsheets and paper lists with a user-friendly, mobile-responsive interface. Users can easily search, filter, and update their collections on the go ‚Äî whether they're browsing at home, preparing a DJ set, or crate digging in a record shop.

Vinyl records have seen a major resurgence in popularity, and tools like **Vinyl Crate** empower collectors to track, rate, and catalogue their collections in a modern, cloud-based format. Built as part of a Level 5 Web Application Development course, Vinyl Crate focuses on usability, functionality, and clean design to deliver a polished user experience for managing music libraries.
