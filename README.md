### Project Overview

**Vinyl Crate** is a full-stack, data-driven web application that empowers users to catalogue, manage, and explore their personal vinyl record collection. Built with **Django**, **PostgreSQL**, and **Bootstrap**, it offers a clean and responsive interface suitable for both desktop and mobile users.

Registered users can add and edit detailed entries for their records — including artist, title, genre, BPM, musical key (Camelot notation), year, and rating — with the option to upload cover art. The app supports secure user authentication, individual dashboards, and record-level control.

**Vinyl Crate** goes beyond simple record keeping — it's a thoughtfully designed platform for music lovers and DJs who want to document and reflect on their collection in a structured, searchable way.

### Project Purpose

Vinyl Crate is designed for vinyl collectors who want a simple, online tool to catalogue their records. Many collectors use spreadsheets or paper lists, but these lack user-friendly interfaces, mobile responsiveness, and features like cover art. Vinyl Crate solves this by offering a secure, cloud-hosted app with core functionality and intuitive UX.
