# ðŸŽµ Vinyl Crate

## ðŸ“Œ Project Purpose

Vinyl Crate is designed for vinyl collectors who want a simple, online tool to catalogue their records. Many collectors use spreadsheets or paper lists, but these lack user-friendly interfaces, mobile responsiveness, and features like cover art. Vinyl Crate solves this by offering a secure, cloud-hosted app with core functionality and intuitive UX.
