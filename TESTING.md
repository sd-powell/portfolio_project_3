Testing was an **integral part of the development process**, ensuring that the Vinyl Crate application remained both **functional and user-friendly** at every stage. Through **continuous testing**, issues were identified and resolved early, contributing to a smoother development workflow and a more reliable final product.

**Chrome Developer Tools** were used extensively to monitor page responsiveness, diagnose styling and layout issues, and debug JavaScript and form interactions. This allowed for efficient troubleshooting and performance tuning during both frontend and backend development.

**ChatGPT** was a key support resource throughout the project. It helped refine user flows, debug Django logic, structure testing strategies, and optimize content and interface decisions. The guidance received led to more maintainable code, better practices, and improved overall project quality.

To ensure the site was **responsive and accessible across devices**, all views and forms were manually tested on a range of screen sizes using Chromeâ€™s responsive design mode, alongside physical testing on **desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones**. Special attention was given to form interactions, navigation flow, and data display across breakpoints to guarantee a **consistent user experience**.
